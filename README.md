I created this space to showcase all the projects(big and small) that I've worked on since I started my Master's in Analytics program in 2020.
| Project Name | Description | Date |
| --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| Descriptive Analysis of a Gaming company | TBD | Sept 2020
| [LOS](https://github.com/hellokatechan/learning_outcomes) | A data cleaning project with more than 4 million rows. The goal of this project is to have one LOS (learning outcome statement) per row. | Oct 2020  |
| [Course Catalog](https://github.com/hellokatechan/CourseCatalog) | A web scraping project with the goal to create a dataframe where program manager can query the courses that are required for a specific program.  | Nov 2020 |
| [Course Catalog Part 1](https://github.com/hellokatechan/fuzzywuzzy_part1)| I'm interested in knowing which courses overlap between programs. For example, I've noticed that students in MS in Informatics can take Intermediate Analytics as part of their program requirments. I want to see if between which two programs share the most courses | Dec 2020
| Course Catalog Part 2 | An analysis of the CPS Master's course catalog | Dec 2020 
| Conver Text to PDF files | A quick side project that came up at work. It didn't make sense for anyone to convert 100+ files manually and I know there must be a way to automate the process | Jan 2020
| BlueBike Usage 2020-2021 | To analyze over 2+ million records, I used big data tech stack for this project (i.e Databrick) | Feb 2021
